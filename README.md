# Worms game simulator
  Solution for the homework for the "Computer Graphics Elements".
  It implements a simple heightmap mechanism for terrain creation and deformation.
  The game consists of two players(two worms) that take turn into changing the
environment. Move the mouse to aim and click to release the projectile. You have 
two weapons at your disposal, one that makes a crater or one that generates dirt.
You can change them by pressing Z.
  The goal was to use and alter images as heightmaps and to implement their role
in the graphics shaders. Another goal was to add lighting to the scene.

Here is a demo:
